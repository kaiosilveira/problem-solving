# ðŸ§© Problem-solving

Problem-solving is an integral part of the day-to-day life of every programmer, independent of their current level of expertise. With that in mind, I'm constantly searching for new tiny challenges and solving them as a way to keep my mind fast and sharp. As a natural outcome of that, though, there's code, so I decided to document all the challenges I managed to solve so far, separated by platform.

## ðŸ’» Hacker Rank

Hacker Rank is a platform that provides access to several challenges, with different difficulties, for programmers of all levels. I try to solve a new challenge from there at least once a week, so I created a separate repository to aggregate these solutions, with some tooling to set up a new challenge with all boilerplate code configured. Beyond challenge resolution, each solution comes with a detailed step-by-step description of how to reach the result, proper unit testing, and a heavy analysis of the final solution, including benchmarking and a time complexity overview.

To see the details of all this work, check my repository page [@kaiosilveira/hacker-rank-challenges](https://github.com/kaiosilveira/hacker-rank-challenges).

## ðŸŽ„ Advents of Code

The Advent of Code is an annual event that happens in December and is the programmer's version of an "advent calendar". In the platform, from Dec 1 to Dec 25 a new challenge is released every day. Each challenge consists of two parts, with the second one requiring the implementation of the first. Following the same rationale used above, I'm creating a new repository for each year and documenting both the challenges themselves and my solutions.
